GIT
---
git init # initializes a directory for git use

git clone <remote repository># copy repository
	# eg... git clone https://github.com/aole/bgem.git

git fetch # update local repository with remote changes
			# does not affect local branch states
git fetch origin <foo> # pull all diff commits from remote foo branch locally
git fetch origin <src>:<dest> # pull all diff commits from remote src branch to dest (created if not exists) locally
git fetch origin :<foo> # create new branch foo locally

git status # tells status of the repository (eg. which files changed)

git add <filename> # stage files and to update what will be committed
	git add '*.txt'

git reset <rel path/filename> #unstage file

git commit [-a][-m <"msg">] # -a: auto commit all tracked files

git log # shows log of all commits

git branch <branch name> # create a branch
git branch -f <branch> <pos> # to move branch positions around
	# eg ... git branch -f bugWork HEAD~^2^
git branch -u <remote> [<name>] # set branch name tracking remote
							# if name not provided, checkedout branch is implied
git branch -d <branch> # delete a branch

git merge <branch name> # merge branch to HEAD
						# creates new commit combining the 2 parents

git rebase -i <pos> # = commit previous commits to master
	# eg git rebase -i HEAD~2
git rebase <to commit> # rebase head to commit
git rebase <to commit> <commit> # rebase commit to commit and set head

git checkout <branch name> # switch to branch
	# ~<num> goes back num times
	# ^<num> chooses num parent (parellel)
	# above modifiers can be chained eg .... git checkout HEAD~^2~2
git checkout -b <name> <remote branch> # create a new branch with name and sets it to track remote branch
git checkout -- <file>... # to discard changes in working directory

git push # push local changes to remote; update master and move origin (remote tracking) branch
git push <origin> <place> # commit all (missing in remote) changes from place (branch) to origin (remote)
		# used when new branch not created in remote yet
git push origin <src location>:<destination> # eg.... git push origin foo^:master
							# if destination does not exist, remote will create new destination branch
git push -u <origin> <place> # -u to remember the params and just use git push next time
git push origin :<foo> # removes remote foo branch by pushing "nothing"

git pull origin <master> # pull files from remote master branch and merges with the head
						 # = git fetch + get merge origin
git pull --rebase 		 # = get fetch + get rebase origin
git pull origin foo # = git fetch origin foo; git merge origin/foo

git remote add <name> <url>

git diff HEAD # difference from HEAD

git rm <files> # remove and stage removal
git reset HEAD <file>... # to unstage

git tag <tag/version name> <commit> # creates a tag / permanent pos

git describe <branch> # shows how far you are from a closest ancestral tag

# to ignore some files create a .gitignore file and add ignored files to it (can use patterns)
